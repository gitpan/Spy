Module documentation:

NAME
    B::More - Additional introspection methods and functions

DESCRIPTION
    Adds stuff I needed in B and wasn't there :-)

    Feel free to email me with suggestions for other methods I can add.

  B::SV METHODS
    svref
        Inverse of B::svref_2object.

  B::PVMG METHODS
    magic
        Returns a string containing the types of all MAGIC.

    magic TYPE
        Returns the B::MAGIC object for the magic with specified type, or
        undef if no magic with that type was found.

FUNCTIONS
    defstash
        Returns the default stash (main::) as B::HV object.

    curstash
        Returns the current stash (package) as B::HV object. Note that this
        only makes sense at compile time (in a BEGIN-block or in
        eval-string).
